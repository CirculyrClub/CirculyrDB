[v: 0.4 | 1]

I messed up tonight
I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again

I keep falling down
I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next

Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

[r: Chorus]
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
'Til I reach the end, then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try everything even though I could fail
[x2]
[s:]

Try everything [x3]

Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love
Baby, you've done enough, take a deep breath

Don't beat yourself up
Don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

[g: Chorus]

And I'll keep on making those new mistakes
And I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes

Try everything [x3]

Try everything
